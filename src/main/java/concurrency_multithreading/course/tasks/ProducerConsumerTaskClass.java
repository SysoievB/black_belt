/**
 * <h3>Task: Producer-Consumer Problem</h3>
 * Description:
 * Implement a producer-consumer problem using a shared buffer.
 * <p>
 * Specifications:
 * Use a fixed-size buffer (e.g., an array of size 5).
 * The producer thread adds items to the buffer.
 * The consumer thread removes items from the buffer.
 * Use wait() and notify() for inter-thread communication.
 * Goal: Practice thread synchronization and learn to solve classic concurrency problems.
