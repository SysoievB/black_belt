 * <h6>Task Description: </h6>
 * There are 3 books and 5 students. Each student should read 1 book.
 * Since there are fewer books than students, some books will need to be assigned to multiple
 * students so that all books are actively being read by at least one student. The goal is to
 * assign the books in such a way that each student has a book to read, and each book is read by
 * at least one student.
