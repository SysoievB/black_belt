/**
 * <h3>Task Description: Rocket Launch Countdown</h3>
 * Description:
 * Simulate a rocket launch countdown using the CountDownLatch class in Java. Multiple threads (representing pre-launch checks) must complete their tasks before the countdown reaches zero, allowing the rocket to launch.
 * <p>
 * Specifications:
 * Create a CountDownLatch initialized with a count equal to the number of pre-launch checks (e.g., 5).
 * Each thread represents a pre-launch system (e.g., fuel system, navigation system, communication system) performing a task.
 * Once a system completes its task, it decrements the latch count.
 * The rocket launch thread waits for the latch to reach zero before proceeding with the launch.
 * Goal:
 * Understand how to use CountDownLatch for synchronizing multiple threads.
 * <p>
 * Example Behavior:
 * Pre-launch checks are performed by separate threads:
 * "Fuel system check complete."
 * "Navigation system check complete."
 * ...
 * Once all checks are complete:
 * "All systems ready. Launching rocket!"
